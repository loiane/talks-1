00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.960
SPEAKER: The only thing that
evolves faster than technology

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.350
is our expectations.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.200
We want everything
better, easier, now.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.460
Suddenly, downloading an app
feels like it takes forever,

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.330
and in many parts of the world,
data is still at a premium,

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.390
with one megabyte costing
up to 5% of a monthly wage.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.180
Let's face it,
though-- until now,

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.510
the alternative to native
apps hasn't been great.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.925

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.430
But that was then.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.490
Progressive web apps can now
deliver mobile web experiences

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.710
with a native look and
feel, offering features

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.770
like real-time
push notifications,

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.220
adding a site to
your home screen,

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.589
so you can easily jump back
to it with a single tap

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:49.630
even when you're offline.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.800
Plus the ability to make
quick payments on the go,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.044
and all from your browser.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.886
This is the next generation
of the mobile web.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.054
So what are we waiting for?

00:01:19.422 --> 00:01:21.130
Let's go ahead and
build something great.
